        <p class="about-story__intro">Thanks for stopping by. Here is a little about me and how this shop came to be.</p>

          <h2 class="about-story__heading">Who am I?</h2>
          <p class="about-story__text">I'm Bryonna, a young college student who hopes to teach music someday. I'll be selling handcrafted headbands, keychains, plush toys, beanies, and other small accessories in my shop. I will provide a tiny note with words of encouragement with every order. I am a follower of Jesus Christ, therefore this encouragement will be spiritual in nature! I pray that this business will allow me to serve and love others as closely as possible to how Jesus did. Again, thank you for coming to my page and/or making a purchase! To learn more about how I began crocheting, continue reading.</p>
          <p class="about-story__text">I began crocheting in the summer of 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic. I was looking for a hobby to keep me busy while stuck at home. My mom taught me the basics of crocheting, and I was hooked (no pun intended)! Since then, I have made many different items for friends and family, and I have loved every minute of it. Crocheting has become a therapeutic and joyful activity for me, and I am excited to share my creations with you through Bryonna's Crochet Nook.</p>

          <h2 class="about-story__heading">How My Journey Began</h2>
          <p class="about-story__text">When I visited Walmart one day (in September 2024), I noticed the (presumably large) yarn aisle. Both a hook and a single ball of yarn cost roughly $3. "Hey!" I said to myself. "To pass the time, I could learn to crochet." I enjoy being creative in various ways, and I'm happy that I can now include crocheting in my list of hobbies. Although it required a great deal of patience and time, I am grateful for my current position!</p>

          <div class="about-story__block-content">
            <h2 class="about-story__heading">My First Projects!</h2>
            <p class="about-story__text">I began by making a tiny crocheted heart, and then I proceeded to create a cute, but obviously amateur, frog fairy plush toy. I decided to crochet presents for my family because I wanted to save money and get everyone gifts for the first time. Even though it took some time to get it just right, I was able to learn how to crochet both simple and "fancy" stitches. I can now read patterns, follow the "crocheter language," and create a wide range of items. I hope surfing my shop is worthwhile. As time passes, more items will be available for purchase! Once again, thank you! I hope you have a blessed day!</p>
