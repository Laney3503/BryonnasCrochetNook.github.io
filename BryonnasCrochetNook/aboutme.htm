        <h2 class="featurette-heading"> Who am I?</h2>
        <p class="lead">I'm Bryonna, a young college student who hopes to teach music someday. 
         I'll be selling handcrafted headbands, keychains, plush toys, beanies,
          and other small accessories in my shop. I will provide a tiny note with 
          words of encouragement with every order. I am a follower of Jesus Christ,
           therefore this encouragement will be spiritual in nature! I pray that 
           this business will allow me to serve and love others as closely as 
           possible to how Jesus did. Again, thank you for coming to my page and/or
            making a purchase! To learn more about how I began crocheting, continue
           reading.</p>
           <p class="lead"> I began crocheting in the summer of 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
        I was looking for a hobby to keep me busy while stuck at home. My mom 
        taught me the basics of crocheting, and I was hooked (no pun intended)! 
        Since then, I have made many different items for friends and family, and 
        I have loved every minute of it. Crocheting has become a therapeutic and 
        joyful activity for me, and I am excited to share my creations with you 
        through Bryonna's Crochet Nook.</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">How My Journey Began</h2>
        <p class="lead">When I visited Walmart one day (in September 2024),
           I noticed the (presumably large) yarn aisle. Both a hook and a single
            ball of yarn cost roughly $3. "Hey!" I said to myself. "To pass the 
            time, I could learn to crochet." I enjoy being creative in various
             ways, and I'm happy that I can now include crocheting in my list of
              hobbies. Although it required a great deal of patience and time, I
               am grateful for my current position!</p>

        <h2 class="featurette-heading">My First Projects!</h2>
        <p class="lead">I began by making a tiny crocheted heart,
           and then I proceeded to create a cute, but obviously amateur,
            frog fairy plush toy. I decided to crochet presents for my 
            family because I wanted to save money and get everyone gifts for
             the first time. Even though it took some time to get it just right,
              I was able to learn how to crochet both simple and "fancy" stitches. I can now read patterns, follow the "crocheter language," and create a wide range of items. I hope surfing my shop is worthwhile. As time passes, more items will be available for purchase! Once again, thank you! I hope you have a blessed day!</p>
